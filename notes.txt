Overview

This is a REST API proxy for SparkPost that implements A/B testing.  The usual workflow looks like this:

1. Client sends a group of weighted transmission requests (A, B, C, ...) to proxy
2. Proxy selects a transmission request X using the given weights
3. Proxy sends transmission request X to SparkPost

The proxy supports overriding of any field in the request and automatically mangles the 'campaign_id' field to indicate that an A/B test is in progress.

The proxy will also allow non-A/B Transmission requests to pass through transparently for easy addition and removal of A/B testing capability.

Future Work

Add a UI to manage stored overlay requests for a given campaign ID and template.

Dependancies

 - Node.js
 - Express
 - Momentum 4.1 with 'generation' enabled (or Sparkpost)

Setup

Edit config/production.json:
 - set 'MomentumBaseURL' to your Momentum 4.1 API endpoint
 - set 'APIKey' to an API key for your Momentum 4.1 instance

Start the proxy service:

	$ node MomentumABProxy.js

Usage

The proxy accepts a single full 'base' Transmission request and a set of 'sub-requests', each with a weighting.  The proxy selects a sub-request by weighting and builds the final request overlaying the selected sub-request onto the base request.  The proxy then sends the resulting Transmission request to Momentum for execution.

POST /api/v1/transmissions
{
	// Transmission request fields common to all 'sub-requests'

	// 
	"subrequests": [
		{
			"weight": 0.5,
			"req": { ... }
		},
		{
			"weight": 0.5,
			"req": { ... }
		}
	]
}
